    "# Combinations of a Sum\n",
    "Given an integer array and a target value, find all unique combinations in the array where the numbers in each combination sum to the target. Each number in the array may be used an unlimited number of times in the combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Input: nums = [1, 2, 3], target = 4\n",
    "Output: [[1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 2]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "- All integers in nums are positive and unique.\n",
    "- The target value is positive.\n",
    "- The output must not contain duplicate combinations. For example, `[1, 1, 2]` and `[1, 2, 1]` are considered the same combination."

    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we can use each integer in the input array as many times as we like, we can theoretically create an infinite number of combinations. However, because all numbers are **positive**, the sum of any combination will only increase. Therefore, we can safely **terminate the construction of a combination** once its sum is equal to or exceeds the target value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To **avoid duplicate combinations**, we need a universal representation: each combination must be built in a consistent, non-decreasing order. We achieve this by ensuring that each combination is constructed using elements **in the same order** as they appear in the input array.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these two principles in mind, the best strategy to explore all valid combinations is to use **backtracking**, which allows us to explore the full search space efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### State Space Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "The **state space tree** helps visualize how combinations are built incrementally, one number at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start at the root with an empty combination. For an input array of size `n`, from the root we make `n` decisions — whether to include each of the `n` elements. We then recursively apply the same process to the resulting combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **termination condition** occurs when the current combination's sum exceeds the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this naïve approach may generate **duplicate combinations** in different orders. To prevent this, we maintain a consistent order by using a `start_index`, which represents the position in the array from which we can start adding elements to the current combination. This ensures that we only add elements from the current index or later, preserving order and preventing revisiting earlier elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initially, `start_index = 0`.\n",
    "- At each recursive step, when adding an element `candidates[i]`, we pass `i` as the new `start_index`.\n",
    "- This guarantees that the next elements considered come from `i` onward, avoiding permutations of the same combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique maintains order and prevents duplicates while allowing repeated use of the same element.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine when to terminate a recursive branch, we need to know the sum of the current combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than maintaining a separate sum variable, we can **repurpose the target value**:\n",
    "- Each time we add a number to the combination, we subtract it from the current `target`.\n",
    "- If `target == 0`, we’ve found a valid combination.\n",
    "- If `target < 0`, we can stop exploring the current branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes the algorithm cleaner and more efficient, as the `target` directly represents the remaining value needed to reach the goal."
