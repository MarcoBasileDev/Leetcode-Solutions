    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea is to generate **all** possible permutations of a given array. To achieve this, we need an algorithm that systematically explores each permutation one at a time. **Backtracking** is a natural fit for this task since it allows us to explore all possibilities while pruning invalid paths efficiently. \n",
    "\n",
    "A useful first step in solving backtracking problems is to visualize the **state space tree**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## State Space Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct a permutation, we start by selecting one number from the array for the first position. Then, for each subsequent position, we pick a number that hasn't been used yet. We continue this process until all numbers are used. To track which numbers have already been used, we maintain a **hash set**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given the array `[4, 5, 6]`, we build permutations as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "nums = [4, 5, 6], used = {} choose 4 → [4], used = {4} choose 5 → [4, 5], used = {4, 5} choose 6 → [4, 5, 6], used = {4, 5, 6} → found a permutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we form a complete permutation, we **backtrack** to explore other possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Remove the most recently added number (`6`), returning to `[4, 5]`.\n",
    "2. Since `6` was the only remaining option, backtrack again by removing `5`, returning to `[4]`.\n",
    "3. Now, instead of `5`, try `6` → `[4, 6]` and explore further.\n",
    "4. Continue this process until all permutations are generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Traversing the State Space Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Each **node** in the state space tree represents a partially built permutation. The **root node** represents an empty permutation, and at each level, we add an unused number. The **leaf nodes** represent completed permutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate all permutations using **backtracking**, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose** an unused number and add it to the current permutation. Mark it as used.\n",
    "2. **Recurse** by making a call to explore the next step.\n",
    "3. **Backtrack** by removing the last added number and unmarking it in the used set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time the permutation reaches a length of `n` (size of the input array), add it to the output."
