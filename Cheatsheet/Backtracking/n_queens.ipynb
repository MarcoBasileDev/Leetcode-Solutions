    "Queens can move vertically, horizontally, and diagonally.\n",
    "So, it's only possible to place a queen on a square of the board when:\n",
    "- No other queen occupies the same row.\n",
    "- No other queen occupies the same column.\n",
    "- No other queen occupies either diagonal.\n",

    "### Placing the Queens - Backtracking\n",
    "A straightforward strategy is to place one queen at a time, ensuring each new queen is placed on a safe square where it can't be attacked. If no safe placement is found, we backtrack by repositioning the previously placed queens.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make backtracking more efficient, we place each queen on a new row. This way:\n",
    "- We don't have to worry about conflicts in the same row.\n",
    "- We only check for conflicts in columns and diagonals.\n",
    "- If a queen cannot be placed in any column on a row, we backtrack.\n",

    "### Detecting Attacks\n",
    "Instead of performing a linear search, we can use hash sets to track occupied columns and diagonals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Columns:** Since each row gets exactly one queen, a column is occupied if another queen already exists in that column.\n",
    "- **Diagonals:** \n",
    "  - **Main diagonal (↘)**: A square (r, c) belongs to a diagonal identified by `r - c`.\n",
    "  - **Anti-diagonal (↙)**: A square (r, c) belongs to an anti-diagonal identified by `r + c`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We maintain three hash sets:\n",
    "1. `columns`: Keeps track of occupied columns.\n",
    "2. `diagonals`: Keeps track of occupied `r - c` diagonals.\n",
    "3. `anti_diagonals`: Keeps track of occupied `r + c` diagonals.\n",

    "### Placing and Removing Queens\n",
    "When placing a queen at `(r, c)`, we:\n",
    "- Add `c` to `columns`\n",
    "- Add `r - c` to `diagonals`\n",
    "- Add `r + c` to `anti_diagonals`\n",
    "\n",
    "To remove a queen, we simply remove these values from the hash sets.\n",
    "This allows us to efficiently check and backtrack as needed."
