    "- The first digit `'6'` maps to the letters `['m', 'n', 'o']`, so we create three branches: one for each of these letters.\n",
    "- For each branch (e.g., starting with `'m'`), the next digit `'9'` maps to `['w', 'x', 'y', 'z']`, so we again branch out by appending each of these letters to the current string (e.g., `'mw'`, `'mx'`, `'my'`, `'mz'`).\n",

    "  - For each combination, we construct a string of length `n`, which takes **O(n)** time.\n",
