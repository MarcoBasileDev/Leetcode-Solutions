    "# Cutting Wood\n",
    "You are given an array representing the heights of trees, and an integer k representing the total length of wood that needs to be cut.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, a woodcutting machine is set to a certain height, H. The machine cuts off the top part of all trees taller than H, while trees shorter than H remain untouched. Determine the highest possible setting of the woodcutter (H) so that it cuts at least k meters of wood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume the woodcutter cannot be set higher than the height of the tallest tree in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**<br/>\n",
    "Input: heights = [2, 6, 3, 8], k = 7<br/>\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: The highest possible height setting that yields at least k = 7 meters of wood is 3, which yields 8 meters of wood. Any height setting higher than this will yield less than 7 meters of wood.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**<br/>\n",
    "- It's always possible to attain at least k meters of wood.\n",
    "- There's at least one tree."

    "## **Intuition**\n",
    "In this problem, the search space does not encompass the input array.  \n",
    "We need to **increase** the woodcutter's height setting (H) from **0 to the maximum tree height** to progressively **decrease** the amount of wood collected.  \n",
    "Our goal is to **find the highest value of H** that still allows us to collect **at least** `k` meters of wood.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Determining if a Height Setting Yields Enough Wood**\n",
    "We define a helper function `cuts_enough_wood(H, k)`, which checks whether a given height setting `H` allows us to collect **at least** `k` meters of wood.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- This function calculates the **total wood** obtained by cutting all trees **taller** than `H`.  \n",
    "- If the total **meets or exceeds** `k`, the function returns **true**; otherwise, it returns **false**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A **brute-force** approach would involve calling `cuts_enough_wood` for each possible `H` from **0** to the maximum tree height. However, since the results of this function form a **monotonic sequence** (all `true` outcomes appear before all `false` ones), we can optimize the search using **binary search**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Binary Search**\n",
    "Our goal is to find the **largest value of H** that still cuts **at least** `k` meters of wood. This corresponds to finding the **upper bound** of `H` that satisfies this condition.  \n",
    "To achieve this, we perform an **upper-bound binary search**, where the midpoint is calculated using: **mid = (left + right) // 2 + 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Defining the Search Space**\n",
    "- The **search space** consists of all possible values of `H`, ranging from **0** to the **height of the tallest tree** in the array.  \n",
    "- This range represents all potential values of `H` that could yield `k` meters of wood.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Narrowing the Search Space**\n",
    "1. **Case 1: The midpoint allows us to collect at least `k` meters of wood.**  \n",
    "   - This means the **upper bound** of `H` might be **further right**.  \n",
    "   - **Action:** Narrow the search space **to the right**, including the midpoint.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Case 2: The midpoint does not allow us to collect enough wood.**  \n",
    "   - This means the **upper bound** of `H` is **to the left**.  \n",
    "   - **Action:** Narrow the search space **to the left**, excluding the midpoint.  \n"
