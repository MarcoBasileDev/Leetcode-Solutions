However, we can improve this to **O(m + n)** by merging the arrays in order, taking advantage of the fact that both arrays are already sorted. The goal is to find the median without actually merging the two arrays.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Key Concepts: Odd vs Even Total Length\n","\n","We’ll refer to the combined length of both arrays as the “total length.” The median calculation differs based on whether the total length is odd or even, so we’ll handle them separately.\n","\n","When the arrays are merged, the median lies on the \"inner edge\" of the two halves. The challenge is to determine which elements from each array belong to the left half or the right half of the merged array. We know the size of each half is **half of the total length**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Slicing the Arrays\n","\n","To determine which values belong to each half, we “slice” both arrays into two segments. These segments will have a total of 4 values, split between the left and right partitions. The goal is to find the correct slice where:\n","- All values in the left partition are less than or equal to the values in the right partition.\n","  \n","Since the arrays are sorted, we know that conditions like **L1 ≤ R1** and **L2 ≤ R2** will hold. The critical checks are:\n","- **L1 ≤ R2**\n","- **L2 ≤ R1**\n","\n","For cases where one of the arrays doesn’t contribute to the left partition, we set its left value to **-∞**, ensuring conditions hold by default.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Searching for the Correct Slice\n","\n","The goal is to search through all possible placements of the left and right partitions. We only need to search for **L1**, as the other values (R1, L2, R2) can be inferred from it. We can use **binary search** over the sorted array `nums1` to find **L1**, making the search more efficient.\n","\n","The search space is narrowed based on the following conditions:\n","- If **L1 > R2**, **L1** is too large, so move the search space left.\n","- If **L2 > R1**, **R1** is too small, so move the search space right.\n","- If **L1 ≤ R2** and **L2 ≤ R1**, we've found the correct slice.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Optimizing the Search Space\n","\n","To further optimize the search, ensure that **nums1** is the smaller array. If **nums2** is smaller, swap the arrays, reducing the search space.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Returning the Median\n","\n","Once the binary search identifies the correct slice, we can calculate the median:\n","\n","- **Even total length**: The median is the average of the two middle values. From the partition values **L1, R1, L2, R2**, the median is calculated by selecting the largest value between **L1** and **L2** (from the left partition) and the smallest value between **R1** and **R2** (from the right partition).\n","\n","- **Odd total length**: The right half will contain one extra value. The median is the smallest value between **R1** and **R2**.\n","\n","For both cases, the median is calculated as the sum of the two relevant values, divided by 2 for even-length arrays or returned directly for odd-length arrays."],"metadata":{"id":"DQqkSVpu_7fZ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from typing import List\n","\n","def find_the_median_from_two_sorted_arrays(nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> float:\n","    if len(nums2) < len(nums1):\n","        nums1, nums2 = nums2, nums1\n","\n","    m, n = len(nums1), len(nums2)\n","    half_total_len = (m + n) // 2\n","    left, right = 0, m - 1\n","\n","    while True:\n","        L1_index = (left + right) // 2\n","        L2_index = half_total_len - (L1_index + 1) - 1\n","        L1 = float('-inf') if L1_index < 0 else nums1[L1_index]\n","        R1 = float('inf') if L1_index >= m - 1 else nums1[L1_index + 1]\n","        L2 = float('-inf') if L2_index < 0 else nums2[L2_index]\n","        R2 = float('inf') if L2_index >= n - 1 else nums2[L2_index + 1]\n","\n","        if L1 > R2:\n","            right = L1_index - 1\n","\n","        elif L2 > R1:\n","            left = L1_index + 1\n","\n","        else:\n","            if (m + n) % 2 == 0:\n","                return (max(L1, L2) + min(R1, R2)) / 2.0\n","            else:\n","                return min(R1, R2)"],"metadata":{"id":"juCDTd5zdRkX","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1741707772363,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":865,"user":{"displayName":"Marco Basile","userId":"01738407880737950021"}}},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Complexity Analysis\n","The time complexity is O(log(min(m, n))) because we perform binary search over the smaller of the two input\n","arrays.\n","\n","The space complexity is O(1).\n","\n","Note: this explanation refers to the two middle values as“median values” to keep thingssimple.
