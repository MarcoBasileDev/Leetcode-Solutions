    "## **Intuition**\n",
    "A **brute-force** solution to this problem involves a **linear search** to find the **first and last occurrences** of the target number. However, since the **array is sorted**, we can optimize this by using **binary search**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge of using binary search here is that we need to **find two separate occurrences** of the same number. A standard binary search alone isn't sufficient.  \n",
    "To solve this, it's important to recognize that the problem is **effectively asking us to find the lower and upper bound** of a number in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we can solve the problem in **two main steps**:\n",
    "1. **Perform a binary search** to find the **lower bound** of the target.\n",
    "2. **Perform a binary search** to find the **upper bound** of the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Lower-Bound Binary Search**\n",
    "To find the **start position** of the target, we first define the **search space**.  \n",
    "Since the target could be **anywhere in the array**, the search space should encompass **all indices**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Narrowing the Search Space**\n",
    "At each step in **binary search**, we evaluate the **midpoint value**, which can result in three conditions:\n",
    "- **Midpoint value is greater than the target** → The target must be **to the left**.  \n",
    "- **Midpoint value is less than the target** → The target must be **to the right**.  \n",
    "- **Midpoint value is equal to the target** → We must check if it's the **first occurrence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Handling Each Case**\n",
    "#### **1. Midpoint value is greater than the target**\n",
    "- The **target must be to the left** of this number.  \n",
    "- **Action:** Narrow the search space toward the **left** and **exclude** the midpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Midpoint value is less than the target**\n",
    "- The **target must be to the right** of this number.  \n",
    "- **Action:** Narrow the search space toward the **right** and **exclude** the midpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Midpoint value is equal to the target**\n",
    "- There are **two possibilities**:\n",
    "  - This is the **lower bound** (first occurrence).\n",
    "  - This is **not** the lower bound, so we must **continue searching** further left.\n",
    "- **Action:** Narrow the search space **toward the left** while **including** the midpoint.  \n",
    "- The final value, once the **left and right pointers meet**, is the **lower bound** of the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Upper-Bound Binary Search**\n",
    "This process is **similar** to the **lower-bound search**, except that we're looking for the **rightmost occurrence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference is when the **midpoint is equal to the target**:\n",
    "- Since we're searching for the **last occurrence**, we need to bias our search **toward the right**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Handling the Upper Bound Search**\n",
    "- **If `mid` is greater than the target** → Search **left**.\n",
    "- **If `mid` is less than the target** → Search **right**.\n",
    "- **If `mid` is equal to the target**:\n",
    "  - There are **two possibilities**:\n",
    "    - This is the **upper bound**.\n",
    "    - This is **not the upper bound**, so we must **continue searching right**.\n",
    "  - **Action:** Narrow the search space **toward the right** while **including** the midpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Debugging the Infinite Loop**\n",
    "A **potential issue** occurs when the **left and right pointers** are **right next to each other**.  \n",
    "- The **midpoint** will always be set to `left`, causing the algorithm to **get stuck in an infinite loop**.  \n",
    "- This happens because we repeatedly update `left = mid`, without making real progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Solution: Right Bias for Midpoint**\n",
    "To prevent this, we can **bias the midpoint to the right**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mid = (left + right) // 2 + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Handling Cases Where the Target Doesn't Exist**\n",
    "After both binary searches, we need to verify if the target actually exists:\n",
    "- If the final values found by both searches do not match the target, return -1."
