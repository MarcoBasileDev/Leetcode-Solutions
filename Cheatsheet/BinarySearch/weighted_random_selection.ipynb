    "# Weighted Random Selection\n",
    "Given an array of items, each with a corresponding weight implement a function that randomly selects an item from the array, where the probability of selecting any item is proportional to its weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the probability of picking the item at index i is:\n",
    "$$weights[i] / sum(weights)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Input: weights = [3, 1, 2, 4]<br/>\n",
    "Explanation:<br/>\n",
    "sum(weights) = 10<br/>\n",
    "3 has a 3/10 probability of being selected.<br/>\n",
    "1 has a 1/10 probability of being selected.<br/>\n",
    "2 has a 2/10 probability of being selected.<br/>\n",
    "4 has a 4/10 probability of being selected.<br/>\n",
    "For example, we expect index 0 to be returned 30% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",

    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Uniform Random Selection**: Every index has an equal chance of being selected.\n",
    "- **Weighted Random Selection**: Some items are more likely to be picked than others based on their weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Given weights `[1, 4]`, index 0 has a probability of `1/5` and index 1 has a probability of `4/5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Hashmap Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Idea**: Use a hashmap where each number on the number line is a key, and its corresponding index is the value.\n",
    "- **Drawback**: This method uses a lot of space because we need to store a key-value pair for each number on the number line.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "For weights `[3, 1, 2, 4]`, the hashmap would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Number | Index |\n",
    "|--------|-------|\n",
    "| 1      | 0     |\n",
    "| 2      | 0     |\n",
    "| 3      | 0     |\n",
    "| 4      | 1     |\n",
    "| 5      | 2     |\n",
    "| 6      | 2     |\n",
    "| 7      | 3     |\n",
    "| 8      | 3     |\n",
    "| 9      | 3     |\n",
    "| 10     | 3     |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Prefix Sum Approach (More Efficient)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Idea**: Store only the endpoints of each segment using prefix sums.\n",
    "- **Advantage**: This method is more space-efficient as it only requires storing `n` values (one for each endpoint).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "For weights `[3, 1, 2, 4]`, the prefix sums are `[3, 4, 6, 10]`.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Why and When Can We Use Binary Search?\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search is a powerful algorithm that works efficiently on **sorted data**. In this problem, we can use binary search because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sorted Prefix Sums**: The prefix sums array is inherently sorted because each prefix sum is the cumulative sum of the weights. For example, for weights `[3, 1, 2, 4]`, the prefix sums `[3, 4, 6, 10]` are in ascending order.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Finding the Lower Bound**: We need to find the **first prefix sum that is greater than or equal to the target**. This is a classic use case for binary search, as it can efficiently narrow down the search space in `O(log n)` time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Efficiency**: Binary search reduces the time complexity from `O(n)` (linear search) to `O(log n)`, making it ideal for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditions for Using Binary Search:\n",
    "- The data must be sorted (or sortable).\n",
    "- The problem must involve searching for a specific value or condition (e.g., finding the first value >= target).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, the prefix sums array satisfies both conditions, making binary search the optimal choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-Step Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Calculate Prefix Sums\n",
    "\n",
    "Given weights `[3, 1, 2, 4]`, calculate the prefix sums:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Index 0: 3\n",
    "- Index 1: 3 + 1 = 4\n",
    "- Index 2: 4 + 2 = 6\n",
    "- Index 3: 6 + 4 = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "Prefix sums array: `[3, 4, 6, 10]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Generate a Random Target\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate a random number between 1 and the total sum (10). For example, let's pick `5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Binary Search to Find the Index\n",
    "\n",
    "Use binary search to find the first prefix sum that is greater than or equal to the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initial Search Space**: `[3, 4, 6, 10]`\n",
    "- **Target**: `5`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First Iteration**:\n",
    "   - Midpoint: `4` (index 1)\n",
    "   - Since `4 < 5`, move the left pointer to `mid + 1` (index 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Second Iteration**:\n",
    "   - Midpoint: `6` (index 2)\n",
    "   - Since `6 >= 5`, move the right pointer to `mid` (index 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Termination**:\n",
    "   - Left and right pointers meet at index 2.\n",
    "   - The first prefix sum >= `5` is `6`, which corresponds to index `2`."
