    "# Hamming Weights of Integers\n",

    "## Intuition – Count Bits for Each Number\n",
    "\n",
    "A straightforward approach to count bits is to iterate from `0` to `n`, and for each number, count the number of set bits (`1`s) in its binary representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:  \n",
    "Let `x = 25`, whose binary form is `11001`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To count the set bits:\n",
    "- Use `x & 1` to check if the **least significant bit (LSB)** is `1`.\n",
    "- Right shift `x` to check the next bit.\n",
    "- Repeat until `x == 0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check LSB using bitwise AND:\n",
    "   ```text\n",
    "   x    = 11001   (25)\n",
    "   1    = 00001   (1)\n",
    "   ------------------\n",
    "   res  = 00001   → LSB is 1\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2. Right shift to move to the next bit:\n",
    "   ```text\n",
    "   11001 >> 1 = 01100\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. Repeat:\n",
    "    - If `(x & 1) == 1`, increment the count.\n",
    "    - Perform `x >>= 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat the above steps until `x == 0`. Doing this for all numbers from `0` to `n` gives the count of set bits for each number."

    "\n",
    "  However, if we assume a fixed integer size (e.g., 32 bits), then each operation takes constant time.  \n",
