    "\n",
    "A brute-force solution to this problem involves exploring all possible combinations of moving 1 or 2 steps up the stairs until reaching the top. But how would we implement this? Let's consider how we reach step `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key observation is that to reach step `i`, we must have arrived from either:\n",
    "1. Step `i - 1`, by taking a single step.\n",
    "2. Step `i - 2`, by taking a double step.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the number of ways to reach step `i` is the sum of:\n",
    "- The number of ways to reach step `i - 1` (`climbing_stairs(i - 1)`).\n",
    "- The number of ways to reach step `i - 2` (`climbing_stairs(i - 2)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This highlights that the problem exhibits **optimal substructure**, meaning that solving `climbing_stairs(n)` depends on solving two of its subproblems. We can express this as the recurrence relation:\n",

    "\n",

    "- If `n == 2`, there are two ways to reach the top (taking two single steps or one double step).\n",

    "This recursive approach is considered **top-down**, as it starts from the main problem (`n`) and breaks it down into smaller subproblems recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, examining the recursion tree reveals that we perform redundant computations by solving the same subproblem multiple times. This inefficiency becomes significant for large `n`, leading to exponential time complexity. This is where **memoization** comes into play.\n",

    "\n",
    "Memoization involves storing the results of subproblems the first time they are computed and reusing them when needed. This technique significantly reduces the number of recursive calls, optimizing the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "We typically use a **hash map (dictionary)** or an **array** to store previously computed results for constant-time access.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying memoization, we transform our approach into a **more efficient** solution with a time complexity of **O(n)** instead of the exponential **O(2^n)** of plain recursion."
