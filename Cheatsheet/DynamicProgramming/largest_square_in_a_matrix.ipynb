    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "The brute-force solution to this problem involves checking every possible submatrix to determine whether it forms a square composed entirely of 1s.  \n",
    "This can be done by treating each cell as the top-left corner of a square and expanding in both dimensions to verify whether all elements in the square are 1s.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is highly inefficient — with a time complexity of **O(n³)** or worse — so we look for a more optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Observation\n",
    "\n",
    "Squares are **composed of smaller squares**. This implies that we can **build larger squares from smaller ones**, which is a strong indication of the presence of **overlapping subproblems** — a classic case for **Dynamic Programming (DP)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, for any given cell `(i, j)`, if `matrix[i][j] == 1`, then the size of the square that ends at `(i, j)` is determined by the **minimum size** of the squares ending at:\n",
    "- The cell directly **above**: `(i-1, j)`\n",
    "- The cell directly to the **left**: `(i, j-1)`\n",
    "- The cell at the **top-left diagonal**: `(i-1, j-1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to the following recurrence relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if matrix[i][j] == 1:\n",
    "    max_square(i, j) = 1 + min(\n",
    "        max_square(i - 1, j),\n",
    "        max_square(i - 1, j - 1),\n",
    "        max_square(i, j - 1)\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### DP Formulation\n",
    "We define a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the side length of the largest square that ends at position `(i, j)`.\n",
    "The transition becomes:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if matrix[i][j] == 1:\n",
    "    dp[i][j] = 1 + min(\n",
    "        dp[i-1][j],\n",
    "        dp[i-1][j-1],\n",
    "        dp[i][j-1]\n",
    "    )\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    dp[i][j] = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We keep track of a `max_len` variable that stores the largest side length encountered during DP table computation. At the end, the area of the largest square is simply `max_len ** 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Base case\n",
    "The first row and column are special cases:\n",
    "- For any cell `(i, 0)` or `(0, j)`, if `matrix[i][j] == 1`, then `dp[i][j] = 1`. These cells can form only 1x1 squares, since they lack neighbors on the top, left, or diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filling the DP Table\n",
    "1. Initialize the first row and column based on the input matrix.\n",
    "2. Starting from cell `(1, 1)`, fill in the DP table row by row, applying the recurrence relation.\n",
    "3. Track `max_len` during the iteration.\n",
    "4. Return `max_len ** 2` at the end — the area of the largest square of 1s."
