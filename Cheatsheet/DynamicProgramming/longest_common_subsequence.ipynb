    "# Longest Common Subsequence\n",
    "Given two strings, find the length of their longest common subsequence (LCS). A subsequence is a sequence of characters that can be derived from a string by deleting zero or more elements, without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Input: s1 = 'acabac', s2 = 'aebab'\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "```"

    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "A naive approach to finding the **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** would be to generate all possible subsequences for both strings and find the longest matching one. However, this approach is highly inefficient, requiring **exponential time complexity**. Instead, we can use **dynamic programming (DP)** to optimize our solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Insight: Inclusion or Exclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "For any character in either string, we have two choices:\n",
    "1. **Include** it in the LCS if it matches a character in the other string.\n",
    "2. **Exclude** it and move forward to check other possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to two primary cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case 1: Characters Match\n",
    "If the characters at the current indices `i` and `j` match, we include them in the LCS and move to the next character in both strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "LCS(i, j) = 1 + LCS(i+1, j+1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case 2: Characters Do Not Match\n",
    "If the characters at `i` and `j` are different, we have two options:\n",
    "1. Exclude the character from **string 1** and find LCS of the remaining part: `LCS(i+1, j)`.\n",
    "2. Exclude the character from **string 2** and find LCS of the remaining part: `LCS(i, j+1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we want the longest subsequence, we take the **maximum**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "LCS(i, j) = \\max(LCS(i+1, j), LCS(i, j+1))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dynamic Programming Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we encounter **overlapping subproblems**, where the same subproblem is solved multiple times, we use **DP** to store previously computed results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transition Formula\n",
    "Using a **bottom-up DP table**, let `dp[i][j]` represent `LCS(i, j)`. The formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "dp[i][j] =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "1 + dp[i+1][j+1], & \\text{if } s1[i] = s2[j] \\\\\n",

    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Base Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- If either string is empty, `LCS = 0`, so we initialize:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "dp[len(s1)][j] = 0 \\quad \\forall j\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "dp[i][len(s2)] = 0 \\quad \\forall i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the **last row and last column** in the DP table are set to `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## DP Table Population\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start filling the DP table **from the last character** of both strings.\n",
    "2. Move **backward** through the table, computing values for smaller subproblems first.\n",
    "3. The final answer is stored in `dp[0][0]`, representing the LCS length of the full strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This **bottom-up approach** ensures that each subproblem is solved only once, leading to an efficient **O(N × M) time complexity**, where `N` and `M` are the lengths of the input strings.\n",
