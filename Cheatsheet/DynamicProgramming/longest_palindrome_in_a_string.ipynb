    "## Intuition\n",
    "A naive solution to this problem is to check every possible substring and save the longest palindrome found. It takes approximately O(n<sup>2</sup>) time to generate all substrings for a string of length n, and for each of these substrings, it takes O(n) time to check if it's a palindrome. This results in an overall time complexity of O(n<sup>3</sup>), which is expensive. So, we should consider a more efficient approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Determining if a substring is a palindrome\n",
    "An important observation is that palindromes contain shorter palindromes within them. This highlights a subproblem: to identify if a string is a palindrome, we can check if its inner substring is also palindrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, a substring from index i to j is a palindrome given two conditions:\n",
    "1. Its first and last characters are the same (s[i] == s[j]).\n",
    "2. The substring from index i + 1 to j - 1 (s[i + 1 :  j - 1]) is also palindrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only situation where this isn't true is when the substring is of length 0, 1, or 2, in which case there is no inner substring.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem has an optimal substructure since we solve a subproblem to obtain the solution to the main problem. This indicates that DP is well-suited for solving this problem. Let's say that dp[i][j] tells us if the substring s[i : j] is palindrome. Based on our earlier observations, we can say that:\n",
    "\n",
    "dp[i][j] = True if s[i] == s[j] and dp[i + 1][j - 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Base cases\n",
    "We mentioned earlier that substrings of length 1 and 2 have no inner substrings In other-words, there are no further subproblems to solve when determining if they are palindrome. As such, these substrings define our base cases:\n",
    "- Base case: All substrings of length 1 are palindromes. So, set dp[i][j] to true for all values of i.\n",
    "- Base case: Substrings of length 2 are palindromes if both of its character are the same. So, set dp[i][i + 1] to true if s[i] == s[i + 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Populating the DP table\n",
    "Determining if longer substrings are palindromes depends on the DP values of shorter substrings. Therefore, we should populate the DP table for the shortest substrings first, starting with checking all substrings of length 3 and working our way up to length n, where n denotes the length of the input string.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keeping track of the longest palindromic substring\n",
    "As we populate the DP table, we also need to keep track of the longest palindromic substring encountered. We use two variables for this: start_index and max_len.\n",
    "- start_index: stores the starting index of the longest palindromic substring found so far.\n",
    "- max_len: stores the length of the longest palindromic substring found so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we find a new, longer palindromic substring, we update these two variables. By the end, start_index and max_len will indicate the position and length of the longest palindrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, return the substring using s[start_index : start_index + max_len].\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution is a classic example of \"interval DP\", which is used to solve optimization problems involving subproblems over intervals of data. In this case, the \"intervals\" are effectively the substrings between indexes i and j."

    "An important observation of the previous approach is that the base cases represent the centers of palindromes. Understanding this, another possible strategy is to expand outward from each base case to find the longest palindrome.\n",
