    "At each cell, we can either **move right** or **move down**. No matter which direction we choose at any point, it will always bring us closer to the destination. This means we just need to keep moving either right or down until we can no longer do so, at which point we've reached the **bottom-right corner**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's analyze the problem **backward**. Suppose we are already at the **bottom-right corner**. How did we get here? We know for certain that we arrived from either:\n",

    "This pattern applies to any cell in the matrix, leading to the following generalization:\n",
