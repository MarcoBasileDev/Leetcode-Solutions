    "# Minimum Coin Combination\n",

    "\n",
    "In this problem, there's no restriction on the number of coins we can use, which makes a brute-force approach that tries every possible coin combination infeasible due to the infinite number of possible combinations. This indicates the need for a more efficient method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the coin set `[1, 2, 3]` and a target of `5`.  \n",
    "If we use a `3`-dollar coin, then we only need `2` more dollars to reach `5`. This gives us a new target: finding the fewest number of coins needed to make `2` dollars. This shows that we've identified subproblems within the main problem, where each subproblem requires finding the minimum number of coins needed for a smaller target. Each coin we use creates a new subproblem.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A path that results in a target of `0` means the coins used in that path add up to `5`. If the target becomes negative, the path is invalid, so we should stop extending it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've observed how new subproblems are created but haven't yet addressed how to solve them efficiently. Each subproblem needs to return the minimum number of coins required to reach its target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the main problem with a target of `5`. To solve this, we first need to determine the minimum number of coins required for each of its three subproblems (targets `4`, `3`, and `2`). The solution to the main problem is the smallest result among these subproblems, plus `1`, to account for the coin used to create the subproblem. This highlights an **optimal substructure**, allowing us to define the following recurrence relation:\n",

    "for coin in coins:\n",

    "for coin in coins:\n",
    "    if coin <= target:\n",
    "        dp[target] = min(dp[target], 1 + dp[target - coin])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This snippet only includes the calculation for a single target value. In our top-down solution, this calculation is repeated for every target value, starting from the initial target and moving down to the base case (`target == 0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the bottom-up solution, we reverse this order by starting with the base case and working our way up to the target value (hence the name \"bottom-up\"). This is necessary because our DP array calculation depends on the values of smaller targets. Therefore, we must compute the solutions for smaller targets first.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be achieved using a `for` loop that iterates from `1` to `target` (starting at `1`, since the base case of `0` is already initialized):\n",

    "for t in range(1, target + 1):\n",
    "    for coin in coins:\n",
    "        if coin <= t:\n",
    "            dp[t] = min(dp[t], 1 + dp[t - coin])\n",
