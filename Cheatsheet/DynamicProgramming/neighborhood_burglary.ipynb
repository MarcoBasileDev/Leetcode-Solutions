    "# Neighborhood Burglary\n",
    "You plan to rob houses in a street where each house stores a certain amount of money. The neighborhood has a security system that sets off an alarm when two adjacent houses are robbed. Return the maximum amount of cash that can be stolen without triggering the alarms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Input: houses = [200, 300, 200, 50]\n",
    "Output: 400\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: Stealing from the houses at indexes 0 and 2 yields 200 + 200 = 400 dollars."

    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple greedy approach—always robbing the house with the most money—fails because it overlooks the long-term consequences of its choices and doesn't always yield the highest total profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's approach this problem differently. Imagine breaking into houses along a street and eventually reaching the last house, denoted as `i`. How much money has been stolen up to this point?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this, we need to consider the two choices at house `i`: should we skip it or rob it?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If we skip it**, the total amount stolen remains the same as at house `i - 1`.\n",
    "- **If we rob it**, we couldn't have robbed the previous house (`i - 1`), so the total money stolen would be the sum of:\n",
    "  - The money from the current house (`houses[i]`).\n",
    "  - The total stolen up to house `i - 2` (since we had to skip `i - 1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can define our recurrence relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{profit}(i) = \\max(\\text{profit}(i - 1), \\text{houses}[i] + \\text{profit}(i - 2))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal strategy is whichever choice results in the largest amount of money.\n",
    "\n",
    "This highlights two key aspects:\n",
    "1. **Overlapping subproblems** – We repeatedly solve the same problem for different house indices.\n",
    "2. **Optimal substructure** – The optimal solution for house `i` depends on the optimal solutions for houses `i - 1` and `i - 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these properties, **dynamic programming (DP)** is a suitable approach. Let's define `dp[i]` as the maximum amount we can steal up to house `i`. Based on our previous discussion:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$dp[i] = \\max(dp[i - 1], \\text{houses}[i] + dp[i - 2])$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the DP array is populated using this formula, the final answer is simply `dp[n - 1]`, which represents the maximum amount that can be stolen once we reach the end of the street.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Base Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's consider the base cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single house (`n = 1`)**  \n",
    "   If there's only one house, the total stolen is just the money in that house:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$dp[0] = \\text{houses}[0]$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Two houses (`n = 2`)**  \n",
    "   We can only rob one of them, so we take the maximum:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$dp[1] = \\max(\\text{houses}[0], \\text{houses}[1])$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "Since our recurrence formula requires values at `i - 1` and `i - 2`, these base cases ensure we can safely start from `i = 2` without running into index out-of-bound errors.\n"

    "### Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` denotes the number of houses. This is because each index of the DP array is computed at most once.\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity is **O(n)** since we maintain a DP array of `n` elements.\n",

    "From the DP formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "dp[i] = \\max(dp[i - 1], \\text{houses}[i] + dp[i - 2])\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "an important observation is that to compute `dp[i]`, we only need the previous two values: `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`. This means we don't need to store the entire DP array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we can optimize space usage by maintaining only two variables:\n",
    "- `prev_max_profit`: stores the value of `dp[i - 1]`\n",
    "- `prev_prev_max_profit`: stores the value of `dp[i - 2]`\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step, we update these variables iteratively, eliminating the need for an array. This optimization reduces the **space complexity to O(1)** since no additional auxiliary data structures are used."
