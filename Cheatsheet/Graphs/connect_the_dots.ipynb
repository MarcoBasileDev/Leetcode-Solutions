    "## Intuition\n",
    "Let's treat this problem as a **graph problem**, imagining each point as a **node**, and the **cost of connecting any two points** as the **weight of an edge** between those nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to connect all nodes (points) such that the **total cost is minimized**. This is essentially the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MST of a weighted graph connects all nodes while minimizing the total weight and avoiding cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main algorithms to solve MST:\n",
    "- **Kruskal's algorithm**\n",
    "- **Prim's algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kruskal's Algorithm\n",
    "**Kruskal's algorithm** is a greedy method to construct the MST by adding the **lowest-weight edges first**, while **avoiding cycles**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Generate all possible edges by calculating the **Manhattan distance** between each pair of points.\n",
    "2. Sort the edges in **increasing order of weight (distance)**.\n",
    "3. Initialize a **Union-Find** (Disjoint Set Union) structure to detect cycles.\n",
    "4. Iterate through the sorted edges and:\n",
    "   - Add the edge if it **does not cause a cycle** (i.e., the points are in different components).\n",
    "   - Skip the edge if it **would create a cycle** (i.e., the points are already connected).\n",
    "5. Stop when we've added exactly `n - 1` edges (where `n` is the number of points).\n",
    "\n",
    "This guarantees a minimum-cost tree that connects all points.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Avoiding Cycles\n",
    "To avoid cycles, we use the **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)** data structure:\n",
    "- `find(x)` determines the root parent of node `x`.\n",
    "- `union(x, y)` connects the components containing `x` and `y`, and returns `true` if merged, `false` if already connected (i.e., would form a cycle).\n",

    "Let `n` be the number of points.\n",
    "- There are **O(n²)** possible edges since we consider all pairs of points.\n",
    "- Sorting the edges takes **O(n² log n)** time.\n",
    "- We perform at most **n²** `union` operations, each in **amortized O(α(n))** time (with path compression and union by rank), which is nearly constant.\n",
