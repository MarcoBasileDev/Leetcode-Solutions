    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Before determining how to find all the islands in a matrix, let's first consider a scenario where the matrix contains only **one island**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix with Just One Island\n",
    "\n",
    "We iterate through the matrix from the top-left corner. The first land cell we encounter (e.g., **cell (0,2)**) belongs to an island. From this point, we want to **discover the rest of the island**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Observation:\n",
    "- Every land cell (**1**) within an island is connected **horizontally or vertically** to another land cell.\n",
    "- Conceptually, this is similar to a **graph traversal**, where:\n",
    "  - Each **cell** is a **node**.\n",
    "  - Each connection to an adjacent land cell is an **edge**.\n",
    "- This means we can use **Depth-First Search (DFS)** to explore the entire island.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Depth-First Search (DFS)\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent revisiting the same land cell, we need a mechanism to mark **visited** cells. Two common approaches:\n",
    "1. **Use a separate data structure**, such as a hash set.\n",
    "2. **Modify the matrix in-place**, changing visited land cells from `1` to `-1`.  \n",
    "   - We’ll use **option 2** to avoid extra space usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DFS Strategy:\n",
    "- **Iterate through the matrix.**\n",
    "- When we find a `1`, mark it as visited (`-1`).\n",
    "- **Recursively call DFS** on its **unvisited** neighboring land cells.\n",
    "- Once we finish exploring an island, **increment a counter** to track the number of islands.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Matrix with Multiple Islands\n",
    "\n",
    "To count all islands in a matrix, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Iterate through the matrix**, starting from **(0,0)**.\n",
    "2. When a **land cell (1)** is found:\n",
    "   - Explore the entire island using **DFS**, marking visited cells as `-1`.\n",
    "   - Increment the **island count** by **1**.\n",
    "3. Continue searching the matrix for **unvisited land cells**.\n",
    "4. Repeat steps **2-3** for each new island found.\n",

    "### Traversing the Matrix in Four Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "To efficiently explore all neighboring land cells, use **direction vectors**:\n",

    "dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n",
