    "# Longest Increasing Path\n",

    "## Intuition\n",
    "In this problem, we need to find the **longest strictly increasing path** in a matrix. The term **\"strictly\"** means that the path cannot include two consecutive cells with equal values.\n",
    "\n",
    "From any cell, we can move to a neighboring cell **only if** that neighbor has a **larger** value. We can visualize this matrix as a **graph**, where:\n",
    "- Each **cell** is a **node**.\n",
    "- A **directed edge** exists from a **smaller-valued** cell to a **larger-valued** neighbor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observing the Graph Structure\n",
    "On closer inspection, this graph is a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**:\n",
    "1. The graph is **directed** because we can **only** move from a **smaller** cell to a **larger** one.\n",
    "2. The graph is **acyclic** because we can never return to a smaller value in the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that **finding the longest increasing path in the matrix** is equivalent to **finding the longest path in a DAG**. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Traversing the Matrix\n",
    "One way to solve this is to:\n",
    "- Compute the **longest increasing path starting from each cell**.\n",
    "- Return the **maximum** of these values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we need a way to explore all possible increasing paths from a given cell and determine the longest one. **Depth-First Search (DFS)** is a natural choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How DFS Works:\n",
    "1. Start a **DFS** at the first cell `(0,0)`.\n",
    "2. To find the **longest path starting from this cell**, explore **all neighboring cells** with **higher values**.\n",
    "3. Make a recursive **DFS** call for each of these **larger neighbors**.\n",
    "4. The longest path from `(0,0)` is the **maximum** of the values returned by DFS, **plus 1** (to include `(0,0)` itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the matrix forms a **DAG**, there's **no need** to explicitly mark cells as \"visited\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the final answer:\n",
    "- **Run DFS for every cell** in the matrix.\n",
    "- **Track the longest path starting from each cell**.\n",
    "- The **maximum** of these values gives the **longest increasing path** in the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimizing with Memoization\n",
    "An important observation is that **DFS might be called on the same cell multiple times**. Once we've computed the **longest path from a cell**, we **don't** need to compute it again. \n",
    "\n",
    "To optimize this, we use **memoization**:\n",
    "- Store the **DFS result** for each cell in a **cache**.\n",
    "- If DFS is called on a cell **again**, simply return the cached result instead of recomputing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reduces redundant calculations and improves efficiency."
