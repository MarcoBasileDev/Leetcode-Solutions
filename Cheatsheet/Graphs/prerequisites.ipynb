    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to determine whether it is possible to enroll in all courses. Let's first identify situations where enrollment is impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a simple case with just two courses. If each course is a prerequisite for the other, a cycle forms in the graph representation of the courses, making enrollment impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This highlights a key observation: it is **impossible to enroll in all courses if there is a circular dependency** between them. In other words, the course dependency graph **must not contain a cycle** for full enrollment to be possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important point is that the first courses that can be completed are those without prerequisites. In the graph representation, such courses have **no incoming edges**. We define the number of incoming directed edges to a node as its **in-degree**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topological Sorting\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we use **topological sorting**, which orders the vertices of a graph such that for every directed edge `u -> v`, node `u` appears before node `v` in the ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "A well-known algorithm for performing topological sorting is **Kahn’s Algorithm**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kahn’s Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of Kahn’s Algorithm is to compute the **in-degree** of each course. This is done by counting how many times each course appears as a dependent in the prerequisite pairs.  \n",
    "For a pair `[a, b]`, course `b` depends on course `a`, so the in-degree of course `b` is incremented by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given the prerequisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prerequisites = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [3, 2], [1, 4], [2, 4], [4, 5]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We compute the in-degrees:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "in_degrees = [0, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we process all courses with an **in-degree of 0** first. These courses have no prerequisites, so they can be taken immediately. We add them to a queue for processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "in_degrees = [0, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1] queue = [0, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we start processing the queue:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pop the first course from the queue:** Course `0`.\n",
    "2. **Reduce the in-degree of its dependent courses:** For each course that has course `0` as a prerequisite (i.e., courses pointed to by course `0`), decrement their in-degree by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "After processing course `0`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "in_degrees = [0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1] queue = [3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If any course's in-degree becomes `0`, add it to the queue. Course `1` now has an in-degree of `0`, so we add it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "in_degrees = [0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1] queue = [3, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- If we have processed **all `n` courses**, it means there is no cycle, and enrollment is **possible**.\n",
    "- If we **could not process all `n` courses**, a cycle exists, making enrollment **impossible**."
