    "# Shortest Transformation Sequence\n",
    "Given two words, start and end, and a dictionary containing an array of words, return the length of the shortest transformation sequence to transform start to end. A transformation sequence is a series of words in which:\n",
    "- Each word differs from the preceding word by exactly one letter.\n",
    "- Each word in the sequence exists in the dictionary.\n",
    "If no such transformation sequence exists, return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Input: start = 'red', end = 'hit',\n",
    "       dictionary = [\n",
    "            'red', 'bed', 'hat', 'rod', 'rad', 'rat', 'hit', 'bad', 'bat'\n",
    "       ]\n",
    "Output: 5\n",

    "## Intuition\n",
    "In a **transformation sequence**, each step involves changing **one letter** of a word to obtain another valid word. Given a **starting word** and a **target word**, we can model this as a **graph problem**, where:\n",
    "- Each **word** is a **node**.\n",
    "- An **edge** exists between two words if they **differ by exactly one letter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the **shortest transformation sequence**, we need to determine the **shortest path** from the **start word** to the **end word**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finding the Shortest Path\n",
    "Whenever a graph problem requires finding the **shortest path**, **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** should be considered. BFS explores all neighbors at a **distance of 1**, then **distance of 2**, and so on. The first time we reach the **end word**, we are guaranteed to have done so using the **fewest** transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement BFS:\n",
    "1. Use **level-order traversal**, where each level represents words that are a **specific distance** from the start word.\n",
    "2. Track visited words using a **hash set** to avoid revisiting them.\n",
    "3. Return the length of the shortest transformation sequence (the BFS level count).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building the Graph\n",
    "The challenge is identifying **neighbors** for each word. Given a word `\"red\"`, its neighbors can be found by:\n",
    "- Changing **each letter** to **every other letter** in the alphabet.\n",
    "- Checking if the new word exists in the **dictionary**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make dictionary lookups **efficient**, we store the words in a **hash set**, allowing for **O(1) lookups**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge Case:\n",
    "- If the **start or end word** is missing from the dictionary, return `0`, since a valid transformation **must** use words from the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Space Optimization\n",
    "Instead of **precomputing an adjacency list**, we can **generate neighbors on demand** during BFS traversal. This saves memory while still allowing efficient traversal."

    "### Optimization - Bidirectional Traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "An important observation is that we don't necessarily need to begin level-order traversal at the start word; we can also start a search at the end word. In fact, we can combine these by performing them simultaneously to find the shortest path. This is known as **bidirectional BFS**, or in this case, **bidirectional level-order traversal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we perform two searches—one from the start and one from the end—the idea is that they will meet in the middle if a path between these two words exists. If a path doesn't exist, the searches will never meet, indicating that a transformation sequence does not exist. This optimization allows us to identify the shortest distance more quickly.\n",

    "To simulate this process, we alternate between the two level-order traversals, progressing through each search one level at a time:\n",

    "- **End traversal**: Process one level in the traversal that started from the end node.\n",

    "We continue alternating between these two steps until a node visited in one search has already been visited in the other search, indicating that the traversals have met. To check if a node has already been visited by the other traversal, we can query the **visited hash set** used by the opposite search. If a word exists in the visited hash set of the other traversal, we know the searches have met."
