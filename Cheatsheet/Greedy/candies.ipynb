    "You teach a class of children sitting in a row, each of whom has a rating based on their performance. You want to distribute candies to the children while abiding by the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each child must receive at least one candy.\n",
    "- If two children sit next to each other, the child with the higher rating must receive more candies.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Case 1: Uniform Ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "If all children have the **same rating**, no one is \"better\" than the others.  \n",
    "**Give 1 candy to each child** — both conditions are satisfied.\n",
    "\n",

    "If ratings are **strictly increasing**, each child must get **more candies than their left neighbor**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start with the first child: 1 candy.\n",
    "- For each subsequent child:\n",
    "  - If `rating[i] > rating[i - 1]`, then `candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1`.\n",

    "Each child must get **more candies than their right neighbor**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start from the last child: 1 candy.\n",
    "- For each previous child:\n",
    "  - If `rating[i] > rating[i + 1]`, then `candies[i] = candies[i + 1] + 1`.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Case 4: Mixed Ratings (Non-uniform)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ratings can vary arbitrarily, increasing and decreasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use **two passes** to combine both strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Left to right**: Handle increasing trends.\n",
    "2. **Right to left**: Handle decreasing trends.\n",
