    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "A naive approach to this problem is to **sort the array**. When all numbers are arranged in ascending order, consecutive numbers will be placed next to each other. This allows us to traverse the array and identify the longest sequence of consecutive numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach requires sorting, which takes **O(n log n)** time, where _n_ is the length of the array. Let's see if we can do better.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to note that every number in the array can represent the start of a consecutive sequence. One approach is to treat each number as the start of a sequence and search through the array to identify the rest of its chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any number `num`, its next consecutive number will be `num + 1`. This means we always know which number to look for when trying to extend a sequence."
