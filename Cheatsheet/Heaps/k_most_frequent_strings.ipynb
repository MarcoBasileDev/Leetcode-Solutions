    "# K Most Frequent Strings\n",
    "Find the k most frequently occurring strings in an array, and return them sorted by frequency in descending order. If two strings have the same frequency, sort them in lexicographical order.\n",

    "**Example:**\n",
    "Input: strs = ['go', 'coding', 'byte', 'byte', 'go', 'interview', 'go'], k = 2<br/>\n",
    "Output: ['go', 'byte']\n",

    "To solve this problem efficiently, we must address two main challenges:  \n",
    "1. **Identifying the k most frequent strings**  \n",
    "2. **Sorting these strings** first by frequency (descending) and then lexicographically (ascending in case of ties).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### **1. Identifying the k Most Frequent Strings**\n",
    "We use a **hash map (dictionary)** to store string frequencies:\n",
    "- **Keys** → Unique strings  \n",
    "- **Values** → Corresponding frequencies  \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple but inefficient approach is to:\n",
    "1. **Sort all strings** by frequency in descending order.\n",
    "2. **Select the first k strings** from the sorted list.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, sorting **all n strings** takes **O(n log n) time**, even though we only need the top k.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Optimized Approach: Using a Max-Heap**\n",
    "Instead of sorting the entire list, we leverage a **max-heap** (priority queue) to efficiently extract the top k elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why a Max-Heap?**\n",
    "- The most frequent string **always stays on top**.\n",
    "- By removing the top element k times, we efficiently get the k most frequent strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Heap Operations**\n",
    "1. **Build the heap**  \n",
    "   - Push all **(string, frequency)** pairs into the heap.\n",
    "   - Instead of inserting elements one by one (**O(n log n)**), we can use the **heapify operation**, which constructs the heap in **O(n) time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extract k elements from the heap**  \n",
    "   - Pop the **most frequent** string from the heap **k times**.\n",
    "   - Each pop operation takes **O(log n)**, making this step **O(k log n)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Handling Lexicographic Order**\n",
    "When two strings have the same frequency, the one **earlier in lexicographic order** should have higher priority.  \n",
    "- We define a **custom comparator** for the heap:\n",
    "  - **Primary sorting** → By frequency (descending).  \n",
    "  - **Secondary sorting** → By string value (ascending).  \n",

    "- **Building the heap** → **O(n)**\n",
    "- **Extracting k elements** → **O(k log n)**\n",
