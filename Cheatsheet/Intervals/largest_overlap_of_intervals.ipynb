    "# Largest Overlap of Intervals\n",
    "Given an array of intervals, determine the maximum number of intervals that overlap at any point. Each interval is half-open, meaning it includes the start point but excludes the end point.\n",

    "## **Intuition**\n",
    "Understanding how intervals overlap is key to solving this problem. The number of overlapping intervals at any given point represents the count of \"active\" intervalsâ€”intervals that have started but not yet ended.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the maximum number of overlapping intervals, we need to:\n",
    "1. Identify when an interval starts (increment active count).\n",
    "2. Identify when an interval ends (decrement active count).\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests an approach that **processes start and end points separately**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Processing Start and End Points**\n",
    "- **Start Point:** When encountering a start point, increment `active_intervals` since a new interval has begun.\n",
    "- **End Point:** When encountering an end point, decrement `active_intervals` since an interval has concluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "By processing all points in order, we can track the number of active intervals at any moment. The highest recorded value of `active_intervals` gives us the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Edge Case: Concurrent Start and End Points**\n",
    "A key edge case arises when a start point coincides with an end point (i.e., they have the same value). In such cases, **we must process end points before start points** to ensure accurate counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Iterating Over Interval Points in Order**\n",
    "To efficiently process intervals, we:\n",
    "1. **Extract all start and end points** into a single list.\n",
    "2. **Sort them**, ensuring that when a start and end point are the same, the end point is processed first.\n",
    "3. **Sweep through the sorted points**, updating `active_intervals`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is known as a **\"Sweep Line Algorithm\"**. The idea is to \"sweep\" a vertical line over all interval points in sorted order, tracking changes in the number of overlapping intervals dynamically."
