The order of nodes at each level must be preserved.\n","2. All nodes at one level must be connected before appending nodes from the next level.\n","\n","The challenge lies in how to process the linked lists at lower levels efficiently. One might consider using a breadth-first search (BFS), but BFS typically requires a queue, leading to at least linear space complexity. The goal is to find a way to merge the levels in place without using extra space.\n","\n","### Key Observation\n","\n","Each node in a multi-level linked list has access to the next level's nodes through its `child` pointer. This allows us to connect the nodes at level `L + 1` to the end of level `L`, effectively merging the two levels.\n","\n","### Approach\n","\n","1. **Append Nodes from Level `L + 1` to Level `L`:**\n","   - Traverse the nodes of level `L` to find the tail node.\n","   - Use a separate pointer `curr` to traverse the list. When `curr` encounters a node with a non-null `child`, append that child list to the tail of level `L`.\n","   - After appending, update the tail pointer to the last node of the newly extended list.\n","\n","2. **Repeat the Process:**\n","   - Continue this process for each subsequent level. For each node with a `child`, append the child list to the tail and adjust the tail pointer accordingly.\n","\n","3. **Nullify Child Pointers:**\n","   - After appending a child list, set the `child` pointer to null to ensure the linked list is fully flattened.\n","\n","### Final Steps\n","\n","- Once all levels have been processed, return the head of the flattened linked list."],"metadata":{"id":"Rmr4Hw_lH-XG"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class MultiLevelListNode:\n","    def __init__(self, val=None, next=None, child=None):\n","        self.val = val\n","        self.next = next\n","        self.child = child\n","\n","\n","def flatten_multi_level_list(head: MultiLevelListNode) -> MultiLevelListNode:\n","    if not head:\n","        return None\n","\n","    tail = head\n","\n","    while tail.next:\n","        tail = tail.next\n","\n","    curr = head\n","\n","    while curr:\n","        if curr.child:\n","            tail.next = curr.child\n","            curr.child = None\n","\n","            while tail.next:\n","                tail = tail.next\n","\n","        curr = curr.next\n","\n","    return head"],"metadata":{"id":"PE5oyleSMtMJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1741679700727,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":884,"user":{"displayName":"Marco Basile","userId":"01738407880737950021"}}},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Time Complexity\n","\n","The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` denotes the number of nodes in the multi-level linked list.
