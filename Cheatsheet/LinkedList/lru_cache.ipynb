    "Let's clearly understand the problem. Given a cache that holds **3 elements**, when it reaches **full capacity**, inserting a new value requires two operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Eviction**: Remove a key-value pair from the **least recently used (LRU)** end of the cache.\n",
    "2. **Insertion**: Add a key-value pair to the **most recently used (MRU)** end of the cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieving a value also involves two operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Update Usage**: Move a key-value pair to the **most recently used** end of the cache.\n",
    "4. **Lookup**: Access a value using its key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've narrowed the design down to these **core operations**, we can determine which **data structures** best support them.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Operations 1 & 2: Efficient Insertions & Removals**\n",
    "We need to:\n",
    "- **Remove** a key-value pair from **one end** of a data structure.\n",
    "- **Add** a key-value pair to **the other end**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **linked list** is well-suited for this, as we can add and remove nodes in **constant time (O(1))** if we have a reference to the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Singly vs. Doubly Linked List:**\n",
    "- **Adding/removing a node from the head**:  \n",
    "  - **O(1)** time for both **singly** and **doubly** linked lists.\n",
    "- **Removing the tail node**:  \n",
    "  - **O(n)** for a **singly** linked list (even with a tail reference, we must traverse to the previous node).  \n",
    "  - **O(1)** for a **doubly** linked list (each node stores a reference to its previous node).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we choose a **doubly linked list**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To efficiently reference both ends of the list, we define:\n",
    "- **Head** → Least Recently Used (**LRU**) node.\n",
    "- **Tail** → Most Recently Used (**MRU**) node.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Operations 3 & 4: Fast Key Lookup & Reordering**\n",
    "- We need to **move** a node to the **MRU end**, regardless of its current position.  \n",
    "  - If the node is **in the middle**, we’d have to traverse the list to find it.\n",
    "  - Since each node is associated with a **key**, we can use a **hash map** (dictionary) to store **key → node** mappings.\n",
    "  - This allows us to access a node in **O(1)** time.\n",
