## Real-word Example

Computer graphics: In 3D rendering, geometry is used to represent objects as shapes like polygons, and mathematical transformations such as rotation, scaling, and translation, are applied to these objects to animate them, or change their perspective. Algorithms that use trigonometry, vector math, and matrix operations, are critical for determining how objects move, interact with light, or cast shadows in virtual environments.
