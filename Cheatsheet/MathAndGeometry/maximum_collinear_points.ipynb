    "# Maximum Collinear Points\n",
    "Given a set of points in a two-dimensional plane, determine the maximum number of points that lie along the same straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Input: points = [[1, 1], [1, 3], [2, 2], [3, 1], [3, 3], [4, 4]]\n",
    "Output: 4\n",

    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Two or more points are **collinear** if they lie on the same straight line. In other words, the **slope** between any pair of points among them will be equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The slope between two points (X_a, Y_a) and (X_b, Y_b) is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{slope} = \\frac{Y_b - Y_a}{X_b - X_a}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this formula, we can compute the slope between all pairs of points. However, simply counting how many pairs share the same slope is **not sufficient**, since multiple pairs may have the same slope but not lie on the same line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we can improve the approach by fixing one point at a time as a **focal point**, and then counting how many other points are collinear with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improved Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each point in the input, treat it as a **focal point**.\n",
    "2. For every other point, compute the **slope** with respect to the focal point.\n",
    "3. Use a hash map (dictionary) to count how many times each slope occurs.\n",
    "4. The maximum value in this hash map gives the number of points that are collinear with the current focal point.\n",
    "5. Repeat for each point, and keep track of the overall maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge Case: Vertical Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "If two points have the same x-coordinate, the denominator of the slope formula becomes 0. Since division by zero is undefined, we handle vertical lines by using a special representation such as `'inf'` or a constant symbol to denote **infinite slope**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Avoiding Precision Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "Floating-point division may lead to precision errors. To avoid this, represent slopes as **fractions of integers**, i.e., a tuple (dy, dx), where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\(dy = Y_b - Y_a\\)\n",
    "- \\(dx = X_b - X_a\\)\n",
    "\n",
    "This preserves exact values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Consistent Slope Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that different pairs with the same slope have identical representations, reduce the slope to its **simplest form** by dividing both components by their **greatest common divisor (GCD)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a slope of (4, 6) should be reduced to (2, 3). Also, always normalize the sign: typically, keep the denominator positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)\n",
    "\n",
    "The GCD of two integers is the largest number that divides both without leaving a remainder. By dividing \\(dy\\) and \\(dx\\) by their GCD, we get a normalized and consistent representation of the slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that all equivalent slopes are stored using the same key in the hash map, leading to correct counts."
