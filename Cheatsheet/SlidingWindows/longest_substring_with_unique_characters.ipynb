    "The **brute-force approach** involves examining all possible substrings and checking whether any contain only **unique** characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Brute-force Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "- Checking a substring for uniqueness can be done in **O(n) time** by scanning it and using a **hash set** to track characters.  \n",
    "  - If we encounter a **duplicate**, we know the substring is not unique.\n",
    "- Iterating through **all possible substrings** takes **O(n²) time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the overall **brute-force time complexity** is: O(n^3)\n",

    "### **Optimizing with Sliding Window**\n",
    "We can categorize any window in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Case A: Unique Characters**  \n",
    "   - The window contains **only distinct** characters (no duplicates).  \n",
    "   - In this case, **expand** the window by moving the **right pointer** to check for a **longer valid substring**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Case B: Contains Duplicates**  \n",
    "   - The window contains **at least one character with frequency > 1**.  \n",
    "   - When encountering a **duplicate**, **shrink** the window by moving the **left pointer** until the duplicate is removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Sliding Window Setup**\n",
    "To implement the **sliding window** approach, define:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`left` and `right` pointers** → Start both at the beginning of the string to define the window boundaries.\n",
    "- **`hash_set`** → Maintain a hash set to track **unique** characters within the window, updating it as the window expands.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method **optimizes** the approach and reduces time complexity significantly.\n"
