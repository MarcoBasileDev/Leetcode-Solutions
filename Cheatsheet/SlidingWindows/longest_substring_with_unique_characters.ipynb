    "The **brute-force approach** involves examining all possible substrings and checking whether any contain only **unique** characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Brute-force Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "- Checking a substring for uniqueness can be done in **O(n) time** by scanning it and using a **hash set** to track characters.  \n",
    "  - If we encounter a **duplicate**, we know the substring is not unique.\n",
    "- Iterating through **all possible substrings** takes **O(n²) time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the overall **brute-force time complexity** is: O(n^3)\n",

    "### **Optimizing with Sliding Window**\n",
    "We can categorize any window in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Case A: Unique Characters**  \n",
    "   - The window contains **only distinct** characters (no duplicates).  \n",
    "   - In this case, **expand** the window by moving the **right pointer** to check for a **longer valid substring**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Case B: Contains Duplicates**  \n",
    "   - The window contains **at least one character with frequency > 1**.  \n",
    "   - When encountering a **duplicate**, **shrink** the window by moving the **left pointer** until the duplicate is removed.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **`left` and `right` pointers** → Start both at the beginning of the string to define the window boundaries.\n",
    "- **`hash_set`** → Maintain a hash set to track **unique** characters within the window, updating it as the window expands.\n",

    "- Continuously advance the **left pointer** to **shrink** the window **until** the duplicate was removed.\n",

    "- Instead of advancing **one step at a time**, we can **jump** the left pointer **directly past** the last occurrence of the duplicate character.\n",

    "### **Optimized Strategy**\n",
    "- If we **track the last seen index** of each character, we can **immediately** move the **left pointer** just past that index.\n",
    "- This avoids unnecessary shifts, making the approach **more efficient**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Using a Hash Map**\n",
    "To implement this, we:\n",
    "1. Use a **hash map** (`prev_indexes`) to store the **last seen index** of each character.\n",
    "2. When encountering a **duplicate**, check if its **previous index** is **inside** the window:\n",
    "   - If the previous index is **after** the **left pointer**, move `left` **past** this index.\n",
    "   - If the previous index is **before** the **left pointer**, **ignore** it (it’s no longer in the window).\n",
    "\n",
    "This **further optimizes** the approach by reducing unnecessary movements."
