    "# Longest Uniform Substring After Replacements\n",

    "## **Intuition**\n",
    "### **Determine if a substring is uniform**\n",
    "Before we try finding the longest **uniform substring**, let's first determine the most efficient way to make a string uniform with the **fewest** character replacements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **key observation** is that the **minimum number** of replacements needed to achieve uniformity is obtained by **replacing all characters except the most frequent one**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that if we know the **highest frequency** of a character in a substring, we can determine if our value of **k** is sufficient to make that substring uniform.  \n",
    "The number of characters that need to be replaced (`num_chars_to_replace`) can be found using:\n",
    "\n",
    "num_chars_to_replace = total characters in substring - highest frequency character count\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've calculated `num_chars_to_replace`, we can assess if the substring can be made uniform:\n",
    "- **If** `num_chars_to_replace ≤ k`, the substring **can** be made uniform.\n",
    "- **If** `num_chars_to_replace > k`, the substring **cannot** be made uniform.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Tracking the highest frequency character**\n",
    "To calculate `num_chars_to_replace`, we need to know the **highest frequency character** in the substring.  \n",
    "This requires tracking the **frequency** of each character, which can be efficiently managed using a **hash map** (`freqs`).  \n",
    "This hash map allows us to **update** `highest_freq` whenever we encounter a character with a **higher frequency**.\n",

    "## **Dynamic Sliding Window**\n",
    "We know that **sliding windows** are useful for solving substring-related problems.  \n",
    "This problem requires that we find the **longest substring** that satisfies the condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "num_chars_to_replace <= k\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, a **dynamic sliding window** might be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Expanding or Shrinking the Window**\n",
    "We use the above condition to decide when to **expand** or **shrink** the window:\n",
    "- **If the condition is met**, expand the window to **find a longer valid substring**.\n",
    "- **If the condition is violated**, shrink the window **until it becomes valid again**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Insight: Sliding Instead of Shrinking**\n",
    "When we find a valid window of a certain length, **no shorter window** will provide a longer uniform substring.  \n",
    "This means we can **slide** the window instead of **shrinking** it whenever we encounter an **invalid window**, effectively maintaining the length of the current window.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this insight, we can refine our previous logic:\n",
    "- **If the window satisfies the condition:** expand.\n",
    "- **If the window doesn’t satisfy the condition:** slide."
