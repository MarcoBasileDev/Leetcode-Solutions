    "# Substring Anagrams\n",
    "Given two strings, s and t , both consisting of lowercase English letters, return the number of substrings in s that are anagrams of t.\n",
    "\n",
    "An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**<br/>\n",
    "Input: s = 'caabab', t = 'aba'<br/>\n",
    "Output: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: There is an anagram of t starting at index 1 (\"caabab\") and another starting at index 2 (\"caabab\")"

    "## **Intuition**\n",
    "We can rethink the concept of an **anagram** by slightly modifying its definition:  \n",
    "A **substring** of `s` qualifies as an **anagram** of `t` if it contains **exactly the same characters** as `t`, in **any order**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Observations**\n",
    "1. **Fixed Length Constraint**:  \n",
    "   - For a substring of `s` to be an anagram of `t`, it **must** have the same length as `t` (denoted as `len_t`).\n",
    "   - This means we **only** need to consider substrings of `s` that are exactly `len_t` in length.\n",
    "   - This saves us from checking **every possible substring** and allows us to use the **Fixed Sliding Window** technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using a Sliding Window**:\n",
    "   - A **window** of size `len_t` slides through `s`, ensuring that every possible substring of this length is examined.\n",
    "   - We need a way to **check if the current window is an anagram of `t`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Checking for Anagrams**:\n",
    "   - The **order** of letters in an anagram **doesn't matter**, only the **frequency of each character** does.\n",
    "   - We compare the frequency of characters in the **current window** against the frequency of characters in `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Implementation Plan**\n",
    "To efficiently implement this, we define the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Frequency Arrays**\n",
    "- We store the character counts for `t` in an **array of size 26** (`expected_freqs`), where each index represents a lowercase English letter.\n",
    "- We maintain another **array of size 26** (`window_freqs`) to track the character frequencies **within the current window**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Sliding Window Components**\n",
    "- **Left and Right Pointers (`left`, `right`)**:  \n",
    "  - Both pointers start at the beginning of `s`, defining the **window boundaries**.\n",
    "- **`window_freqs` array**:  \n",
    "  - Tracks the frequency of characters in the current window.\n",
    "- **`count` variable**:  \n",
    "  - Keeps track of the number of anagrams found.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Sliding Window Algorithm**\n",
    "1. **Initialize the Frequency Array**:  \n",
    "   - Compute `expected_freqs` for `t`.\n",
    "   - Initialize `window_freqs` as an empty array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Expand the Window to `len_t`**:  \n",
    "   - Move the `right` pointer until the window reaches size `len_t`, updating `window_freqs` along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check if the Window is an Anagram**:  \n",
    "   - Compare `window_freqs` and `expected_freqs`.\n",
    "   - Since the arrays have a fixed size of 26, the comparison runs in **O(1) time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Slide the Window Across `s`**:  \n",
    "   - Move both `left` and `right` pointers **one step at a time**.\n",
    "   - **Update `window_freqs`**:\n",
    "     - Increment the count of the new character at `right`.\n",
    "     - Decrement the count of the character at `left` (as it leaves the window).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Return `count`**:  \n",
    "   - After scanning `s`, return the total number of anagrams found.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Optimization**\n",
    "- **Edge Case**: If `len_t > len(s)`, return `0` immediately.  \n",
    "  - It's **impossible** to form an anagram if `t` is longer than `s`."
