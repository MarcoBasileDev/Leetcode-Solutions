    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem asks us to sort an array containing only three types of elements: 0, 1, and 2.  \n",
    "A straightforward approach would be to use a built-in sorting function, which has a time complexity of **O(n log n)**. However, this approach **does not take advantage of the constraint** that the array contains only three unique values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we can solve this in **linear time**, **O(n)**, by using a variation of the **Dutch National Flag algorithm**, which efficiently partitions the array into three sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea is:\n",
    "- Move all **0s** to the left,\n",
    "- Move all **2s** to the right,\n",
    "- Leave all **1s** in the middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "By focusing only on placing 0s and 2s in their correct positions, the 1s will automatically end up in the correct place.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "We use **three pointers**:\n",
    "- `left` — marks the boundary for where the next 0 should go.\n",
    "- `right` — marks the boundary for where the next 2 should go.\n",
    "- `i` — the current index being evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "We iterate over the array with `i`, and apply the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If `nums[i] == 0`**:  \n",
    "  Swap `nums[i]` with `nums[left]`, and increment both `left` and `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If `nums[i] == 2`**:  \n",
    "  Swap `nums[i]` with `nums[right]`, and decrement `right`.  \n",
    "  Do **not** increment `i` in this case, because the new element at index `i` (after the swap) has not been evaluated yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If `nums[i] == 1`**:  \n",
    "  Simply increment `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process continues **until `i > right`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do we increment both `i` and `left` when we encounter a 0?\n",
    "\n",
    "A common question is:  \n",
    "**Why do we increment both `i` and `left` when we encounter a 0, but only `right` when we encounter a 2?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the reasoning:\n",
    "\n",
    "When `nums[i] == 0`, we swap it with `nums[left]`. If `i == left`, the swap is redundant but harmless.  \n",
    "After the swap, we can safely increment both `left` and `i` because:\n",
    "- All 0s before `left` are already in place.\n",
    "- `nums[i]` after the swap is either 0 or 1 — in either case, it's safe to continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we incremented only `left` but not `i`, we would risk a situation where `i < left`, which breaks the invariant that `i` must always be between `left` and `right`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when `nums[i] == 2`, and we swap it with `nums[right]`, we cannot increment `i` immediately.  \n",
    "Why? Because the element we just swapped into position `i` could be a 0, 1, or 2 — we haven’t seen it yet.  \n",
    "So, we need to re-evaluate `nums[i]` on the next loop iteration before moving on.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures:\n",
    "- Linear time complexity: **O(n)** — we only scan the array once.\n",
    "- Constant space complexity: **O(1)** — sorting is done in-place.\n",
    "\n",
    "We efficiently partition the array into:\n",
    "- Left region: all 0s  \n",
    "- Middle region: all 1s  \n",
    "- Right region: all 2s"
