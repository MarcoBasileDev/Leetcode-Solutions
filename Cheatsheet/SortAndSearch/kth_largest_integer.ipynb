    "A naive solution would be to sort the array in descending order and return the element at index `k - 1`. While correct, this approach has a time complexity of `O(n log n)`, which is inefficient when we only need the **k-th largest** element—not a fully sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more optimal insight is that if we could maintain the **top k largest elements**, the **smallest among them** would be the k-th largest overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "To efficiently track the top k elements, we can use a **min-heap** (a binary heap where the smallest element is always at the root):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize a min-heap** and push the first `k` elements of the array into it.\n",
    "2. **Iterate through the remaining elements** of the array:\n",
    "   - If the current element is **greater than the heap's root**, pop the smallest element from the heap and insert the current one.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, ignore it.\n",
    "3. At the end of the iteration, the heap contains the top `k` largest elements. The **smallest among them (heap root)** is the **k-th largest overall**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach improves efficiency by avoiding full sorting, and the min-heap ensures we always maintain the correct top-k subset in `O(log k)` time per insertion."

    "## Intuition – Quickselect\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quickselect** is an efficient selection algorithm to find the k<sup>th</sup> smallest (or largest) element in an unsorted array. It builds upon the **partitioning** logic used in **quicksort**, but avoids sorting the entire array.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we want to find the **k<sup>th</sup> largest** element. Since Quickselect naturally finds the k<sup>th</sup> *smallest*, we can instead search for the **(n - k)<sup>th</sup> smallest** element, which is equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quickselect Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose a pivot** (typically random to avoid worst-case behavior).\n",
    "2. **Partition** the array:\n",
    "   - Elements smaller than the pivot move to its left.\n",
    "   - Elements greater move to its right.\n",
    "   - The pivot ends up in its correct sorted position.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recurse on one side only**:\n",
    "   - If the pivot's index is **less than (n - k)**, recurse on the **right** side.\n",
    "   - If it's **greater than (n - k)**, recurse on the **left**.\n",
    "   - If it's **exactly (n - k)**, return the pivot — it's the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This selective recursion is what gives Quickselect its average-case linear time performance.\n",

    "## Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",

    "- **Average Case: O(n)**  \n",
    "  Each partition splits the array approximately in half, and we recurse on only one side. This gives a geometric progression:  \n",
    "  `O(n) + O(n/2) + O(n/4) + ... = O(n)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Worst Case: O(n²)**  \n",
    "  Occurs when the pivot consistently results in extremely unbalanced partitions (e.g., always picking the smallest/largest element).  \n",
    "  This leads to:  \n",
    "  `O(n) + O(n-1) + O(n-2) + ... = O(n²)`.\n",
