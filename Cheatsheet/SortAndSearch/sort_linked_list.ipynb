    "\n",
    "We're sorting a **linked list**, not an array — and this distinction is critical.  \n",
    "Algorithms like **quicksort** rely on random access via indexing, which linked lists **don't support**.  \n",
    "**Merge sort** is ideal here:\n",
    "- Runs in **O(n log n)** time.\n",

    "\n",
    "Merge sort uses a **divide-and-conquer** strategy, consisting of three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Split** the linked list into two halves.\n",
    "2. **Recursively sort** each half.\n",
    "3. **Merge** the sorted halves into a single sorted list.\n",

    "1. Initialize two pointers at the heads of each list.\n",

    "3. Append the smaller node to the result list and move that pointer forward.\n",
