    "# Implement a Queue using Stacks\n",
    "Implement a queue using the stack data structure. Include the following functions:\n",
    "- enqueue(x: int) -> None: adds x to the end of the queue.\n",
    "- dequeue() -> int: removes and returns the element from the front of the queue.\n",
    "- peek() -> int: returns the front element of the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may not use any other data structures to implement the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**<br/>\n",
    "Input: [enqueue(1), enqueue(2), dequeue(), enqueue(3), peek()]<br/>\n",
    "Output: [1, 2]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "- The dequeue and peek operations will only be called on a non-empty queue."

    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "A **queue** follows a **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** order, while a **stack** follows a **LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)** order. Our challenge is to implement a queue **using only stacks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the sequence of operations:\n",
    "1. `enqueue(1)`\n",
    "2. `enqueue(2)`\n",
    "3. `enqueue(3)`\n",
    "\n",
    "These elements would be **pushed** onto a stack in the order `[1, 2, 3]`. If we use `pop()` to dequeue an element, we would get `3`, but we actually need `1` (the first inserted element).\n",
    "\n",
    "To retrieve `1`, we need to **pop all elements from the stack, store them elsewhere, then return the bottom element**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we can only use stacks, we use a **temporary stack** to reverse the order.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimized Two-Stack Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of moving values **back and forth**, we maintain **two stacks**:\n",
    "1. **enqueue_stack**: Used to push values when `enqueue()` is called.\n",
    "2. **dequeue_stack**: Used to pop values when `dequeue()` is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works:\n",
    "- When calling `enqueue(x)`, we simply push `x` onto `enqueue_stack`.\n",
    "- When calling `dequeue()`:\n",
    "  - If `dequeue_stack` **is not empty**, pop from it.\n",
    "  - If `dequeue_stack` **is empty**, transfer all elements from `enqueue_stack` to `dequeue_stack`, then pop from `dequeue_stack`.\n",
    "- The **peek()** function follows the same logic as `dequeue()` but does not pop the top element.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enqueue:** **O(1)** (Just a push operation)\n",
    "- **Dequeue:** **O(1) amortized**, **O(n) worst case** (only when transferring elements)\n",
    "- **Peek:** **O(1) amortized**, **O(n) worst case** (same reasoning as dequeue)\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** **O(n)** (Uses two stacks)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach **minimizes unnecessary transfers** between stacks and ensures an efficient queue implementation using only stacks."
