    "# Repeated Removal of Adjacent Duplicates\n",

    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge in solving this problem is handling **characters that aren't initially adjacent duplicates but become adjacent after removing other duplicates**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insight\n",
    "Instead of scanning the string multiple times, we can **build the string character by character**, immediately **removing adjacent duplicates** as they form.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given `\"abba\"`:\n",
    "1. We remove `\"bb\"`, leaving `\"aa\"`.\n",
    "2. `\"aa\"` is now adjacent and must also be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we need a **data structure** that allows:\n",
    "1. **Adding** characters to one end.\n",
    "2. **Removing** characters from the same end.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **stack** is a strong choice because it supports **both operations efficiently**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stack-Based Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We process the string **one character at a time**:\n",
    "- **Push** the character onto the stack if it's **not a duplicate** of the top element.\n",
    "- **Pop** the top of the stack if it matches the current character (removing the duplicate).\n",
    "- Continue until all characters are processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end, the **stack contains the final string**, so we convert it back to a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** **O(n)**  \n",
    "  - Each character is pushed **at most once** and popped **at most once**.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** **O(n)** (worst case)  \n",
    "  - If no duplicates exist, the stack stores all characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a stack ensures that we **efficiently remove adjacent duplicates** in a **single pass**."
