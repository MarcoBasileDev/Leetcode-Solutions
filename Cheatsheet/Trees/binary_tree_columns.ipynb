Initially, we don't know how many columns lie to the left or right of the root node, but we do know the column containing the root. We will assign this column an ID of 0.\n","\n","- Columns to the right of the root node will have positive IDs.\n","- Columns to the left of the root node will have negative IDs.\n","\n","How do we determine which column a node belongs to? Here's the key observation:\n","- Every time we move to the right, the column ID increases by 1.\n","- Every time we move to the left, the column ID decreases by 1.\n","\n","This allows us to assign column IDs as we traverse the tree. Specifically, for any node:\n","- The column ID of `node.left` is `column - 1`.\n","- The column ID of `node.right` is `column + 1`.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Tracking Node Values by Column ID\n","\n","Now that we have a way to determine the column of each node, we need a way to store which node values correspond to which columns. We can use a hash map, where:\n","- The keys are column IDs.\n","- The values are lists containing the node values for each column.\n","\n","Next, we need to decide which tree traversal algorithm to use for populating this hash map.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n","\n","We could use any tree traversal method to assign column IDs to the nodes, provided we increment the column ID when moving right and decrement it when moving left. However, we must meet two specific requirements:\n","1. Nodes in the same column should be ordered from top to bottom.\n","2. Nodes in the same row and column should be ordered from left to right.\n","\n","BFS processes nodes level by level. It starts at the root and traverses each level horizontally. This ensures:\n","- Nodes are processed from top to bottom.\n","- Nodes in the same row are processed from left to right.\n","\n","By using BFS, we can ensure that node values are added to the hash map in the correct order.\n","\n","Once BFS completes, the hash map will contain lists of values for each column ID. However, this hash map alone is not the expected output.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Creating the Output\n","\n","The problem requires the output to list column IDs from left to right. However, a hash map does not inherently maintain the order of its keys (column IDs). Therefore, we need to find a way to retrieve the column IDs in the desired order.\n","\n","To achieve this:\n","1. Determine the leftmost and rightmost column IDs.\n","2. Iterate through the range `[leftmost_column, rightmost_column]`, ensuring that the output is generated in the correct order.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Complexity Analysis\n","\n","- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we process each node exactly once during the level-order traversal.\n","\n","- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(n), primarily due to the space used by the queue. The queue's size grows with the number of nodes at the level with the most nodes, which in the worst case is at the last level (with approximately `n/2` nodes). The output array created at the return statement does not contribute to the space complexity."],"metadata":{"id":"Cg5jlDcwD20e"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from typing import List\n","from collections import defaultdict, deque\n","\n","class TreeNode:\n","    def __init__(self, val):\n","        self.val = val\n","        self.left = None\n","        self.right = None\n","\n","def binary_tree_columns(root: TreeNode) -> List[List[int]]:\n","    if not root:\n","        return []\n","\n","    column_map = defaultdict(list)\n","    leftmost_column = rightmost_column = 0\n","    queue = deque([(root, 0)])\n","\n","    while queue:\n","        node, column = queue.popleft()\n","\n","        if node:\n","            column_map[column].append(node.val)\n","            leftmost_column = min(leftmost_column, column)\n","            rightmost_column = max(rightmost_column, column)\n","\n","            queue.append((node.left, column - 1))\n","            queue.append((node.right, column + 1))\n","\n","    return [column_map[i] for i in range(leftmost_column, rightmost_column + 1)]\n"],"metadata":{"id":"mfwxTNnHa3jh","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1743763824327,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":322,"user":{"displayName":"Marco Basile","userId":"01738407880737950021"}}},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]}]}
