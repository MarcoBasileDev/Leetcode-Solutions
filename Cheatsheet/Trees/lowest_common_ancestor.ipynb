    "To find the **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)** of two nodes `p` and `q` in a binary tree, we need to determine the **lowest** node in the tree that is an ancestor of both.\n",

    "### Understanding When a Node is an Ancestor\n",
    "A node `x` is an **ancestor** of `p` and `q` if **both** `p` and `q` exist in its subtree (including itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identifying the LCA\n",
    "As we traverse the tree, we check whether the current node:\n",
    "1. **Is itself** `p` or `q`\n",
    "2. Contains `p` or `q` in its **left subtree**\n",

    "Each recursive `dfs(node)` call returns `true` if the subtree rooted at `node` contains either `p` or `q`. This ensures we propagate the existence of `p` and `q` upwards, allowing us to correctly identify the LCA."
