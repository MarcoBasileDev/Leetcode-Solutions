    "- Consists of a sequence of nodes that can begin and end at any node in the tree\n",
    "- Each consecutive pair of nodes in the sequence is connected by an edge\n",
    "- The path must be a single continuous sequence of nodes that doesn't split into multiple paths"

    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the maximum sum of a continuous path in a binary tree, we need to understand what constitutes a valid path. A path in a binary tree is defined as a sequence of nodes where each consecutive pair of nodes is connected by an edge. The path can start and end at any node in the tree, but it must be a single continuous sequence without any splits into multiple paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every path in a binary tree has a root node, which is the highest node in the path. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Root Node of a Path**: Every path has a root node, and the maximum path sum for a given node can be calculated by considering the maximum sums from its left and right subtrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Invalid Paths**: When calculating the maximum path sum for a node, we must ensure that the path is continuous and does not split into multiple branches. For example, if we receive a path sum from a recursive call that includes multiple branches, it would result in an invalid path.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Valid Paths**: To form a valid path, we need to return the sum of a single continuous path from the left or right subtree, not a combination of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recursive Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the maximum path sum, we can use a recursive approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each node, calculate the maximum path sum that can be obtained from its left and right subtrees.\n",
    "- Ensure that the path sums returned from the subtrees are from single continuous paths (i.e., no branching).\n",
    "- The maximum path sum for the current node is the sum of the node's value and the maximum path sums from its left and right subtrees.\n",
    "- However, if either the left or right subtree returns a negative sum, it should be excluded from the calculation, as it would not contribute to the maximum sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Negative Sums\n",
    "\n",
    "If the maximum path sum from the left or right subtree is negative, it should be treated as zero. This is because including a negative sum would reduce the overall path sum, which is not desirable when trying to find the maximum sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of the Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Recursive Calculation**: For each node, recursively calculate the maximum path sum from its left and right subtrees.\n",
    "2. **Single Continuous Path**: Ensure that the path sums returned from the subtrees are from single continuous paths.\n",
    "3. **Exclude Negative Sums**: If the maximum path sum from a subtree is negative, exclude it by treating it as zero.\n",
    "4. **Global Maximum**: Keep track of the global maximum path sum encountered during the traversal."
