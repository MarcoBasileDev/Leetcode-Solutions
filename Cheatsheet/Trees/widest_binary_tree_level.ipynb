    "# Widest Binary Tree Level\n",

    "## Intuition\n",
    "Let's first understand how **width** is defined in a binary tree. An important distinction to make is that the **width of a level** is not necessarily equivalent to the number of nodes in that level.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **null nodes** between the leftmost and rightmost nodes **are considered** in the width as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about a data structure where determining the width or distance between two elements is simple—such as an array—where the distance between two elements can be obtained by the difference between their indexes.  \n",
    "If we could assign **indexes** to nodes in our binary tree, it would be possible to compute the width of a level in a similar way.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Indexing a Binary Tree\n",
    "Below, we see how **indexes** can be assigned to each node, starting with **index 0** for the root node.  \n",
    "These indexes enable us to calculate the width of a level using:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{width} = \\text{rightmost\\_index} - \\text{leftmost\\_index} + 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### How can we set up this indexing?\n",
    "The key observation is that each node's index can be determined from its **parent's index**.  \n",
    "For any node at index `i`, we can derive the following relationships:\n",
    "- Its **left child** will be at index `2 * i + 1`\n",
    "- Its **right child** will be at index `2 * i + 2`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we need a way to traverse each level of the tree to determine the width at individual levels, allowing us to obtain the width of the **widest level** in the tree.  \n",
    "We can achieve this using **level-order traversal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Level-Order Traversal\n",
    "This traversal **uses a queue** to process the binary tree nodes.  \n",
    "In this problem, whenever we push a node into the queue, we also push its **respective index** along with it to track its position.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing the Width of a Level\n",
    "The width of a level is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{width} = \\text{rightmost\\_index} - \\text{leftmost\\_index} + 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform this calculation, we need:\n",
    "1. **The leftmost index** → Set to the index of the first node at the level.\n",
    "2. **The rightmost index** → Initially set to the leftmost index and updated as we traverse the level.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each level, we update `max_width`, which keeps track of the **widest level** in the binary tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complexity Analysis\n",
    "- **Time Complexity: O(n)**  \n",
    "  - Since we process each node **once** during level-order traversal, the complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space Complexity: O(n)**  \n",
    "  - The queue's size grows as large as the **widest level** in the tree.  \n",
    "  - In the **worst case**, this occurs at the last level when all last-level nodes are **non-null**, totaling approximately **n/2** nodes."
