    "# Insert and Search Words with Wildcards\n",
    "Design and implement a data structure that supports the following operations:\n",
    "- insert(word: str) -> None: Inserts a word into the data structure.\n",
    "- search(word: str) -> bool: Returns true if a word exists in the data structure and false if not. The word may contain wildcards ('.') that can represent any letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: [\n",
    "  insert('band'),\n",
    "  insert('rat'),\n",
    "  search('ra.'),\n",
    "  search('b..'),\n",
    "  insert('ran'),\n",
    "  search('.an')\n",
    "]\n",
    "Output: [True, False, True]\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "insert(\"band\") # data structure has: \"band\"\n",
    "insert(\"rat\")   # data structure has: \"band\" and \"rat\"\n",
    "search(\"ra.\")   # \"ra.\" matches \"rat\": return True\n",
    "search(\"b..\")   # no three-letter word starting with â€˜b' in the\n",
    "               # data structure: return False\n",
    "insert(\"ran\")  # data structure has: \"band\", \"rat\", and \"ran\"\n",
    "search(\".an\")  # \".an\" matches \"ran\": return True\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "- Words will only contain lowercase English letters and '.' characters."

    "## Intuition\n",
    "The requirements of this data structure closely resemble those of a **trie**, as it needs to facilitate the **insertion** and **search** of words. What makes this problem unique is the requirement to support **wildcards ('.')** in searches. Let's explore how we need to modify our trie functions to handle wildcards.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Inserting a Word into the Trie**\n",
    "The `insert` function constructs the trie **word by word**, minimizing redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Searching with Wildcards**\n",
    "During a search, we need to handle two scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When encountering a **letter**, we proceed to the child node corresponding to that letter in the trie.\n",
    "2. When encountering a **wildcard ('.')**, we must explore all child nodes, as `'.'` may match any character. This requires performing a **recursive call** for each child node to search for the remainder of the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy allows us to search every possible branch for a word that matches the search term. As soon as we find a matching branch, we return `true`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Helper Function**\n",
    "We need a helper function for searching because we must pass two additional parameters in each recursive call:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Index Tracking:**  \n",
    "   - Defines the start of the remaining substring that needs to be searched.  \n",
    "   - Instead of passing the substring itself (which would require creating a new substring in each call, leading to **O(n) extra time complexity per call**), we simply pass an index.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **TrieNode Reference:**  \n",
    "   - Ensures that each recursive call continues from the current node rather than restarting from the root."

    "- The space complexity of search is:\n",
    "    - O(1) when word contains no wildcards.\n",
    "    - O(k) in the worst case when word contains only wildcards due to the space taken up by the recursive call stack, which can grow up to k in size."
