    "# Next Lexicographical Sequence\n",
    "Given a string of lowercase English letters, rearrange the characters to form a new string representing the next immediate sequence in lexicographical (alphabetical) order. If the given string is already last in lexicographical order among all possible arrangements, return the arrangement that’s first in lexicographical order.\n",

    "## **Intuition**\n",
    "The **next lexicographical sequence** is the first string that is lexicographically **larger** than the original string.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next lexicographical string must:\n",
    "1. **Incur the smallest possible lexicographical increase** from the original string.\n",
    "2. **Use the same letters** as the original string.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Identifying which characters to rearrange**\n",
    "Since our goal is to make the **smallest possible increase**, we need to rearrange characters on the **right side** of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Increasing the rightmost letter** results in a smaller increase than increasing the leftmost letter.\n",
    "- Therefore, we should focus on **rearranging characters on the right-hand side** first, if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key insight is that the **last string in a lexicographical sequence** (i.e., the largest permutation) always follows a **non-increasing order**.  \n",
    "For example, consider `\"abcc\"`, whose largest permutation is `\"ccba\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This observation helps us **identify the suffix that needs to be rearranged**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Finding the pivot**\n",
    "Take the string `\"abcedda\"` as an example.  \n",
    "We traverse it **from right to left** to find the **shortest suffix** that can be rearranged to form a larger permutation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The last **four** characters (`\"edda\"`) form a **non-increasing suffix** and cannot be rearranged to make the string larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the next character, `'c'`, **breaks the non-increasing sequence**.  \n",
    "This character is called the **pivot**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If no pivot is found**, it means the string is already the **last lexicographical sequence**. In this case, we return the **first lexicographical permutation**, which is simply the **reversed string**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Rearranging characters**\n",
    "After identifying the **shortest suffix to rearrange**, the next objective is to **increase the pivot by the smallest possible amount**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we:\n",
    "1. **Find the rightmost character larger than the pivot** within the suffix.\n",
    "2. **Swap this character with the pivot** to increase the lexicographical order.\n",
    "3. **Reverse the suffix** after the pivot to get the smallest permutation possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why reversing the suffix works**\n",
    "After swapping, the suffix remains **non-increasing**.  \n",
    "Reversing it ensures the **smallest possible lexicographical permutation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Algorithm**\n",
    "1. **Locate the pivot**  \n",
    "   - The pivot is the first character (from right to left) that **breaks** the non-increasing sequence.\n",
    "   - If no pivot is found, return the **reverse** of the string.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Find the rightmost successor**  \n",
    "   - Identify the **smallest character larger than the pivot** in the suffix.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Swap the rightmost successor with the pivot**  \n",
    "   - This increases the lexicographical order of the suffix.\n",
    "  \n",
    "4. **Reverse the suffix**  \n",
    "   - This ensures the next permutation is **minimal**."
